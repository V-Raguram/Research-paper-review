**ReRAM-based nvCIM Macro** This paper proposes a 1-Mb Non-Volatile Computing-in-Memory (nvCIM) macro fabricated in 55nm CMOS, designed to eliminate the energy-intensive data movement between off-chip NVM and on-chip processors in AI edge devices. The core innovation is performing analog current-mode MAC operations directly within a 1T1R ReRAM array. To address the challenges of analog computing—specifically high read current, small signal margins, and process variations—the authors introduce a novel circuit hierarchy. The **Serial-Input Non-Weighted Product (SINWP)** structure optimizes array efficiency by separating positive and negative weights. A **Current-Aware Bitline Clamper (CABLC)** dynamically adjusts clamping strength to stabilize bitline voltage against wide current variations. To reduce readout power, a **Down-Scaling Weighted Current Translator (DSWCT)** and **Positive-Negative Current Subtractor (PN-ISUB)** perform analog subtraction of weight currents before sensing, significantly reducing the dynamic range required for the readout. Finally, a **Triple-Margin Current-Mode Sense Amplifier (TMCSA)** amplifies the sensing margin by 3× to ensure accuracy despite small resistance ratios. The design achieves a peak energy efficiency of 53.17 TOPS/W and a latency of 14.6ns for multi-bit MAC operations.

this paper is not in my scope of research. Though i glanced at this as its interesting engineering .
